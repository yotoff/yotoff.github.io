                                 <p>Ivaylo quickly stepped in and started executing his daily tasks on the second week with us on a real customer project. He took his work seriously and made good effort to comply with the processes and decisions we had set. <br><br> As he joined at a peak moment there was always the openly discussed risk that after a period of time we might no longer need his services. The latter was something he fully understood and accepted when that time came along.</p>
